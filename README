== Cappuccino X Juggernaut
by Elias Klughammer

This is a demo application for bringing together the Cappuccino Framework (http://www.cappuccino.org) and the Juggernaut Push Server for Ruby on Rails (http://juggernaut.rubyforge.org/)

Although it is a little bit hacky it shows how you can realise a push-driven Cappuccino application.

Here you can see a demonstration of the sample app:
